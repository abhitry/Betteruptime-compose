# UpGuard - Website Monitoring Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive, enterprise-grade website monitoring platform built with modern microservices architecture, featuring real-time uptime monitoring, performance analytics, and instant alerting capabilities.

## Key Technologies & Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js with TypeScript, JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, Tailwind CSS, responsive design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Message Queue**: Redis Streams for distributed job processing
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds and optimized images
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts for production deployment
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo for efficient build and development workflows

## Core Features Implemented

### üîê **Authentication & Security**
